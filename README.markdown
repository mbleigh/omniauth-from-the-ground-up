# OmniAuth: From the Ground Up

This was a talk given at Red Dirt Ruby Conf 2011. You can get the slides
in Keynote and PDF form in the repo or [see it on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/mbleigh/omniauth-from-the-ground-up).

The example app included is a simple Twitter-based voting app upon which
I attempted to quickly implement an OmniAuth provider for "fake"
developer accounts. Unfortunately, the buzzer intervened before I
completed my given task. However, clone and the magic is yours!
